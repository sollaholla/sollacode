# CI quality gates

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `vp check` (lint + typecheck), `vpr typecheck`, and `vp run test` on pull requests and pushes to `main`.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds macOS (`arm64` and `x64`), Linux (`x64`), and Windows (`x64`) desktop artifacts from a single `v*.*.*` tag and publishes one GitHub release.
- The release workflow auto-enables signing only when platform credentials are present. macOS passkey builds additionally require `APPLE_TEAM_ID` and the `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` secret; Windows uses Azure Trusted Signing. Without the core signing credentials, it still releases unsigned artifacts.
- See [Release Checklist](./release.md) for the full release/signing setup checklist.

The main workflow also checks Rust formatting/tests, builds the desktop package, verifies its preload contract, runs mobile static lint, and exercises release smoke checks. These are CI responsibilities. Local changes should run the focused tests and package typechecks relevant to the edited behavior; see [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).
