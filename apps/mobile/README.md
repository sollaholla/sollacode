# Solla Code Mobile

> [!WARNING]
> Solla Code Mobile is currently in development and is not distributed yet. If you want to try it out, you can build it from source.

## Quickstart

> [!NOTE]
> Uses native modules so using Expo Go is not supported. You need to use the Expo Dev Client.

This app has three variants:

- `development`: Expo dev client, installable side-by-side as `Solla Code Dev`
- `preview`: persistent internal preview build, installable side-by-side as `Solla Code Preview`
- `production`: store/release build as `Solla Code`

Run commands from `apps/mobile`.

## Development

Start Metro for the dev client:

```bash
vp run dev:client
```

Build and run the local iOS dev client:

```bash
vp run ios:dev
```

If your Xcode account only has a Personal Team, use a bundle identifier you control and opt into the
reduced-capability local build. Personal Team builds omit the widget and share extensions, push
entitlement, and native Sign in with Apple entitlement; builds without this opt-in are unchanged.

```bash
T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM=1 \
T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM_BUNDLE_ID=com.example.t3code.dev \
vp run ios:dev
```

Build and install a self-contained Release app that does not need Metro:

```bash
vp run ios:release
```

The Personal Team equivalent also needs a unique bundle identifier:

```bash
T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM=1 \
T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM_BUNDLE_ID=com.example.t3code \
vp run ios:release
```

### Private Tailscale use on an iPhone

Solla Code Mobile connects directly to the same Mac-hosted HTTP/WebSocket backend used by the web
and desktop clients. It does not require a public relay.

1. Join the Mac and iPhone to the same tailnet.
2. In Solla Code on the Mac, open **Settings** → **Connections**, enable **Network access**, and use
   **Create Link** with either the Mac's Tailscale IP endpoint or its Tailscale HTTPS endpoint.
3. In Solla Code Mobile, open **Environments** → **Add environment**, then scan or paste that
   one-time pairing link.

For a personal iPhone installation, use the Personal Team release command above. The repository
generates a reduced-capability Xcode project with a user-owned bundle identifier and no pinned
signing team. Complete the one remaining Xcode signing-and-device Run flow. No public relay or T3
Connect account is part of this path.

Build and run the local iOS preview app:

```bash
vp run ios:preview
```

Force the review diff highlighter engine:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_REVIEW_HIGHLIGHTER_ENGINE=javascript vp run ios:dev
```

`javascript` is the default and recommended setting for the review diff screen. Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVIEW_HIGHLIGHTER_ENGINE=native` only when you explicitly want to test the native Shiki engine.

Inspect the resolved Expo config for a variant:

```bash
vp run config:dev
vp run config:preview
```

Run static checks for mobile native code:

```bash
node ../../scripts/mobile-native-static-check.ts
```

The native lint task runs SwiftLint for Swift plus ktlint and detekt for Kotlin. Missing native tools are reported as warnings and skipped locally. CI installs the default toolset from `apps/mobile/Brewfile` before running the native checks.

## EAS Builds

CI uses Expo fingerprinting with the `preview:dev` profile to reuse an existing compatible build when possible, or start a new internal EAS build when native runtime inputs change. Production and default local builds continue to use the `appVersion` runtime policy.

Create a PR preview dev-client build manually:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:preview:dev
```

Create a cloud dev-client build:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:dev
```

Create a persistent preview build:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:preview
```

Android equivalents:

```bash
vp run eas:android:dev
vp run eas:android:preview:dev
vp run eas:android:preview
```
